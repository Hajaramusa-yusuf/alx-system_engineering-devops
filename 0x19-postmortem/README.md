Postmortem: Outage Incident

Issue Summary:
Duration: May 10, 2023, 14:00 UTC to May 11, 2023, 02:00 UTC
Impact: The web application service experienced intermittent downtime and significant performance degradation, resulting in a slow and unresponsive user experience. Approximately 30% of the users 
were affected, resulting in a loss of revenue and customer dissatisfaction.

Timeline:

14:00 UTC: The issue was detected when the monitoring system triggered an alert for increased response time.
The incident was immediately escalated to the engineering team.
Initial investigation focused on the application servers, assuming a possible performance degradation due to increased traffic.
14:30 UTC: The investigation revealed that the database server was under heavy load, affecting the overall system performance.
Misleading paths: The team initially suspected a misconfiguration or query optimization issue on the database server.
The incident was escalated to the database administration team for further assistance.
15:00 UTC: Database administrators started analyzing the database server logs and running performance diagnostics.
17:00 UTC: The analysis suggested that the issue might be related to a sudden spike in incoming traffic overwhelming the database connection pool.
As a temporary mitigation measure, the database connection pool size was increased.
18:00 UTC: Despite the temporary fix, the performance degradation continued, and the intermittent downtime persisted.
The incident was escalated to the network operations team to investigate any network-related issues.
19:00 UTC: Network engineers examined network traffic patterns and identified a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack targeting the web application.
DDoS mitigation measures were immediately implemented to block the malicious traffic and restore normal operations.
02:00 UTC: The DDoS attack was effectively mitigated, and the web application service was fully restored.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a DDoS attack targeting the web application, resulting in increased database server load and subsequent performance degradation.

Resolution: The incident was resolved by implementing DDoS mitigation measures to block the malicious traffic at the network level. Additionally, the database connection pool size was adjusted to 
handle the increased load effectively. The combined efforts of the network operations and database administration teams helped in successfully mitigating the attack and restoring the service to 
normal operation.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improve DDoS detection and mitigation capabilities by implementing more robust traffic analysis tools and proactive monitoring.

Task: Evaluate and implement an advanced DDoS detection system.
Task: Set up real-time traffic analysis to identify and block suspicious traffic patterns.
Enhance database server scalability and optimize query performance to handle unexpected traffic spikes.

Task: Conduct a thorough review of database server configurations and query optimization strategies.
Task: Implement auto-scaling mechanisms to dynamically adjust database resources based on traffic patterns.
Strengthen network security measures to prevent future DDoS attacks.

Task: Establish a comprehensive network security strategy, including rate limiting, traffic filtering, and anomaly detection.
Task: Regularly update and patch network devices and firewalls to address known vulnerabilities.
Develop incident response plans to streamline communication and coordination during outages.

Task: Define clear escalation paths and roles/responsibilities for each team member during incidents.
Task: Conduct regular incident response drills and post-incident reviews to identify areas for improvement.
By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the impact of future incidents, enhance the overall system resilience, and ensure a seamless user experience.
